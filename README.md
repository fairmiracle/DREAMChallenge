# Modules identification for weighted biological networks

The R Code for ShanHeLab at Disease Module Identification DREAM Challenge, see https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7136340/wiki/403063

Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), igraph, Matrix

License: GPL (>= 2)

## Files
- Comdetect.R: Recursive community detection based on igraph package.
- AMOUNTAIN.R: Modified from AMOUNTAIN package.
- WeightedMethod.R: Multiple modules extraction using AMOUNTAIN.
- util.R: Some additional functions such as rank modules

## Usage
Put the folder "DREAMChallengeCode" at the same level of data folder for both subchallenges. Make a new folder "result" to save the modules, and two subfolders named "result/subchallenge1", "result/subchallenge2".
### Subchallenge 1
```{r}
source('DREAMChallengeCode/Comdetect.R')
filename='subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt'
excuteigraph(filename,'fastgreedy')
```
It taks a while for network 1 using fast-greedy. And also make sure the memory is large enough for holding large matrix and deep recursive procedure. Then the preliminary result would save under "result/subchallenge1". We can see four modules are larger then expected, which needs further division.
```{r}
net = read.delim(filename,header = FALSE)
x = net[,1]+1
y = net[,2]+1
W = sparseMatrix(i = x, j = y, x = net[,3], symmetric = TRUE)
savefile=paste('result/',filename,sep='')
ForAtom(W,savefile,'result/subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt_Atomsize_109')
ForAtom(W,savefile,'result/subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt_Atomsize_159')
ForAtom(W,savefile,'result/subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt_Atomsize_338')
ForAtom(W,savefile,'result/subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt_Atomsize_467')
```
Now all clusters(modules) are saved in "result/subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt". We need to assign the module score (defined as the sum of edges weights) to each module and rank them from highest to lowest. In previous submission we selected part of them to avoid too many false postive ones.
```{r}
source('DREAMChallengeCode/util.R')
modulesid('result/subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt')
reassignScore(filename,'result/subchallenge1/1_ppi_anonym_v2.txt')
```
Now the modules are ranked. For other methods like Louvain, just modify the following line:
```{r}
excuteigraph(filename,'louvain')
```

We also use AMOUNTAIN in subchallenge1. Take network 6 for example, 10 modules sized between 3-100 can be identified by:
```{r}
source('DREAMChallengeCode/WeightedMethod.R')
filename = 'subchallenge1/6_homology_anonym_v2.txt'
savefile = paste('result/',filename,sep='')
excutescrpt(filename,10,savefile,3,100)
```
It takes much longer time by using this optimization based method. Clique with equal edges weights may not be seperatable by this method. Further division is required in this case. Since the module score is already stored in the file, we only need to put the module id ahead and rank them.
```{r}
source('DREAMChallengeCode/util.R')
modulesid('result/subchallenge1/6_homology_anonym_v2.txt')
reassignScore4('result/subchallenge1/6_homology_anonym_v2.txt')
```

The optimization-based approach is still in development. The further plan includes reimplementing by C. See AMOUNTAIN package (https://github.com/fairmiracle/AMOUNTAIN) for the latest news.

### Subchallenge 2
As discribed in the writing-up, the overall network is constructed from a sum matrix of all network, filtered out by a threshold.
```{r}
source('DREAMChallengeCode/Comdetect.R')
returnW <- function(filename,dims){
	net = read.delim(filename,header = FALSE)
	x = net[,1]+1
	y = net[,2]+1
	adj = sparseMatrix(i = x, j = y, x = net[,3], symmetric = TRUE, dims = dims)
}
W1 = returnW('subchallenge2/1_ppi_anonym_aligned_v2.txt',c(21115,21115))
W2 = returnW('subchallenge2/2_ppi_anonym_aligned_v2.txt',c(21115,21115))
W4 = returnW('subchallenge2/4_coexpr_anonym_aligned_v2.txt',c(21115,21115))
W5 = returnW('subchallenge2/5_cancer_anonym_aligned_v2.txt',c(21115,21115))
W6 = returnW('subchallenge2/6_homology_anonym_aligned_v2.txt',c(21115,21115))
W6 = W6/max(W6)
filename='subchallenge2/3_signal_anonym_aligned_directed_v3.txt'
net = read.delim(filename,header = FALSE)
x = net[,1]+1
y = net[,2]+1
W3 = sparseMatrix(i = x, j = y, x = net[,3],dims = c(21115,21115))
W3[lower.tri(W3)] = t(W3)[lower.tri(W3)]
W3 = W3/max(W3)

W = W1+W2+W3+W4+W5+W6
W[W<0.5] = 0
g = graph_from_adjacency_matrix(W,mode='undirected',weighted=TRUE)
V(g)$name=1:length(V(g))
savefile = 'result/subchallenge2/sub2.txt'
recursiveigraph(g,savefile,'fastgreedy')
```

Further division and reassign module scores:
```{r}
ForAtom(W,savefile,'result/subchallenge2/sub2.txt_Atomsize_122')
ForAtom(W,savefile,'result/subchallenge2/sub2.txt_Atomsize_127')
ForAtom(W,savefile,'result/subchallenge2/sub2.txt_Atomsize_334')

source('DREAMChallengeCode/util.R')
modulesid('result/subchallenge2/sub2.txt')
reassignScore2(W,'result/subchallenge2/sub2.txt')
```
